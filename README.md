# UnityTileMap2D
The focus for this project is to provide a simple level creator for tile maps, using the top-down perspective, like seen on Zelda: A Link to the Past, Binding of Isaac and other games. The project is made using Unity3D 5.

## Map creation: how it works
In your scene, create an empty object and add the script "TileMapBuilder".

### TileMapBuilder options

#### Map file
The XML file with the map definition

#### Tile Settings
The `Tile Width` in world units, and the `Tile Height`.

Using Basically, you write a map in XML format in a text file, load it in Unity and click a 'Generate' button.

## Sprites Atribution
I'm using the "Cute Planet" sprite pack from Daniel Cook (http://www.lostgarden.com/2007/05/dancs-miraculously-flexible-game.html)
